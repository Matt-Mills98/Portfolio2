## About

#### Animations

This web app uses Three.js to display background animations. The simple models used by Three were created using Photoshop and Blender. An SVG was created in photoshop, exported to blender, and solidified into an object. This is my first time utilizing both Three.js and blender and I learned quite a bit from the experience.

#### Performance and Accessibility

Using GTMetrix, these were tested. Due to Three.js being a bit CPU-heavy, the performance is not great for lower-end tech. When animations were not rendered, both Perfomance and Accessibility achieved very high scores (both between 95-100)
